<h3>Lesson 45 - Vertex Buffer Objects</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This lesson is pretty irrelevant to three.js and WebGL. Not that VBOs aren't important - they are. It's
  just that they are so intrinsic to WebGL that they aren't in and of themselves interesting. And they are by and large hidden from view by three.js.</p>
